Bluff or I doubt it or Bullshit is a multiplayer card game. Our game is a slight variant of the canadian version. The rules and the gameplay will be explained belowThe objective of a player is to eliminate all the cards in his hand. So any player can start first move. The first player will place any number of cards(face down, i.e the face is not visible). He/she will claim all of them to be a specific number. for example three aces. 


Then the next player will play their turn. They have three choices, 
1) place one or more cards of their own
2) pick up the cards thrown at the last turn (the three aces thrown in our case)
3) pass

The results of each turn is shown below

1) place one or more cards of their own
 If they place one or more cards of their own, then the turn goes to the next player. The player usually says, ex- 2 more aces. so they have placed two cards .Currently number of cards is not considered for bluff.
