Bluff or I doubt it or Bullshit is a multiplayer card game. Our game is a slight variant of the canadian version. The rules and the gameplay will be explained below. The objective of a player is to eliminate all the cards in his hand. So any player can start first move. 

The first player(lets call them player1 ) will place any number of cards(face down, i.e the number on the card should not be visible). He/she will claim all of them to be a specific number. for example three aces. In bluff suits are not important at all. only the number on the card matters.


Then the next player(let's call them player2 ) will play their turn. They have three choices, 
1) place one or more cards of their own
2) pick up the cards thrown at the last turn (the three aces thrown in our case)
3) pass

The results of each turn is shown below

1) place one or more cards of their own
 If they place one or more cards of their own, then the turn goes to the next player. The player usually says, ex- 2 more aces. so they have placed two cards .Currently number of cards is not considered for bluff. 
2) pick up the cards thrown at the last turn (the three aces thrown in our case)

Now this is the actual fun of bluff ! Now the cards picked up (three in our case) should be aces. If they are not aces but something different, as say, 7,3,1 etc then the last player , i.e player1 in our case will have to take into his/her own hand all the cards on the table
